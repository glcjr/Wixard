This program is a GUI for the WIX Toolset.

It builds around the WixSharp project by Oleg Shilo https://github.com/oleg-shilo/wixsharp

It lets you go through the GUI and add the necessary files to your Setup. It then creates a C# script based on what you entered. It can then compile the script.

It can create MSI, Wix files, or a Bootstrapper exe with the help of WixSharp.

For the editor it uses AvalonEdit https://github.com/icsharpcode/AvalonEdit
