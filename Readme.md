This program is a GUI for the WIX Toolset.

It builds around the WixSharp project by Oleg Shilo https://github.com/oleg-shilo/wixsharp

It lets you go through the GUI and add the necessary files to your Setup. It then creates a C# script based on what you entered. It can then compile the script.

It can create MSI, Wix files, or a Bootstrapper exe with the help of WixSharp.

For the editor it uses AvalonEdit https://github.com/icsharpcode/AvalonEdit

For the compiler it uses my Easy Compiler. It needs to be downloaded from my repository in order to compile

It also uses my download nuget project. It also needs to be downloaded from its resository as well. Both source files are linked into Wixard.

If you find the application helpful, a donation would be appreciated.
